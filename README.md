heyyyy
im sleepy so i dont know about reedme but in general

you need to inter in your account first
then you have different menu as admin or user

in some plans you have more choices to do different things
like:
sell assist: it shows you how many products users buoght and how many products have been sold.
delete: as admin you can delete products or users with their id in database.

and as admin you can use all trans to see all of transactions 
or as user you can use my trans that shows you only your transactions

in the end its just a simple one

but if something went wrong let me know (not big fan of testing things)

tnx for your time
